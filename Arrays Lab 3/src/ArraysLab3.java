	//1) Write a method sum that accepts two arrays of integers arr1 and arr2 and returns an array of integers, 
	//in which every element is the sum of the elements at that index for the arrays arr1 and

	//2) Write a method append that accepts an array of integers arr of length n and an integer num, and 
	//returns an array of integers of length n+1 that consists of the elements of arr with num appended to

/*
	Contain
	integer arrays a1, a2, sumArr, appendArr, removeArr
	int variables appendNum, removeIdx, sumOfEvens
	Carry out the following actions
	Declare array a1 containing the values (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40) and array a2 containing the values (7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56)
	Form sumArr by calling the sum method with a1 and a2 as inputs
	Declare int appendNum and set it to 200.
	Form appendArr by calling the append method with a1 and appendNum as inputs
	Declare int removeIdx and set it to 5.
	Form removeArr by calling remove with a2 and removeIdx
	Form sumOfEvens by calling sumEven with appendArr as the input
	Call rotateRight with a1 as the input
	On their own lines print out (use Arrays.toString to transform arrays into a printable strings) :
	sumArr
	appendArr
	removeArr
	sumOfEvens (an int you don’t need Arrays.toString)
	a1
